# MAZE-API
Maze API is a RESTful API that generates a variety of mazes from a selection of recursive algorithms. Users can sign up, receive a key, and request mazes with an extensive suite of parameters.

  Our Approach: In developing this project, our central focus is to keep our source code DRY, provide descriptive and extensive documentation, and implement test driven development. 


## User Stories

  ### Someone learning API:
    
  * Easy to understand docs
  * Easy to see what the shape of the data is (easy to use prams)
  * Accessible to get started 
      * Easy to get a key
      * Ability to get a new key

  ### Game Developer: 

  * Mazes actually work. They are solvable. 
    * It'd be nice to actually get a solution    
  * Consistency of the interface and consistency of returned data
  * Readability: 
    * Data structure has logical flow. I'm able to understand the data on first glance. 
  * Blog article about sample integration
  * Examples of how the algorithms look in maze form

  ### Maze Enthusiast:
    
  * Fun stats.
  * Ability to get really big mazes.
